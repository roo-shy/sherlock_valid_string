#SherlockAndValidString

###Functionality

* I created a new hash (Hash.new takes an argument that will be returned when a key that doesnâ€™t correspond to a hash entry is accessed)

* Knowing that, you can take an array of elements and easily get occurrence counts for each unique element

* Initializing each key to 0 and then incrementing the count each time the element appears

* If the hash has only one key return true

* Return true if the uniq.size is only 2 & the difference between the values is only 1

* Else return false
